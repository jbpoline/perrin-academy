      "The problem of false positives with multiple statistical tests is an old one. One standard method for dealing with this problem is to use the Bonferroni correction. For the Bonferroni correction, you set your p value threshold for accepting a test as being significant as $alpha$ / (number of tests), where $alpha$ is the false positive rate you are prepared to accept. $alpha$ is often 0.05, or one false positive in 20 repeats of your experiment. Thus, for a statistical map with 200000 voxels, the Bonferroni corrected p value would be 0.05 / 200000 = [equivalent Z] 5.03. We could then threshold our Z map to show us only Z scores higher than 5.03, and be confident that all the remaining Z scores are unlikely to have occurred by chance. For some functional imaging data this is a perfectly reasonable approach, but in most cases the Bonferroni threshold will be considerably too conservative. This is because, for most stastistic maps, the Z scores at each voxel are highly correlated with their neighbours."

      "The useful feature of the expected EC is this: when the $Z$ thresholds become high and the predicted EC drops towards zero, the expected EC is a good approximation of the probability of observing one or more blobs at that threshold. So, in the graph above, when the $Z$ threshold is set to 4, the expected EC is 0.06. This can be rephrased thus: the probability of getting one or more regions where $Z$ is greater than 4, in a 2D image with 256 resels, is 0.06. So, we can use this for thresholding. If $x$ is the $Z$ score threshold that gives an expected EC of 0.05, then, if we threshold our image at $x$, we can expect that any blobs that remain have a probability of less than or equal to 0.05 that they have occurred by chance.  The threshold $x$ depends only on the number of resels in our image."

If it was the same, then instead of using RFT for the expected EC, we could use a Bonferroni correction for the number of resels. However, these two corrections give different answers. Thus, for an alpha of 0.05, the $Z$ threshold according to RFT, for our 256 resel image, is $Z=4.05$. However, the Bonferroni threshold, for 256 independent tests, is 0.05/256 = [$Z$ equivalent] 3.55. So, although the RFT maths gives us a Bonferroni-like correction, it is not the same as a Bonferroni correction. As you can see from the simulation above, the random field correction gives a threshold very close the the observed value for a sequence of smoothed images. A Bonferroni correction with the resel count gives a much lower threshold and would therefore be way off the correct threshold for 0.05 false positive rate."

In this case, the EC is the number of 3D blobs - perhaps \"globules\" - of $Z$ scores above a certain threshold. Pixels might better be described as voxels (pixels with volume). The resels are now in 3D, and one resel is a cube of voxels that is of size (FWHM in x) by (FWHM in y) by (FWHM in z). The formula for the expected EC is different in the 3D case, but still depends only on the resels in the image. If we find the threshold giving an expected EC of 0.05, in 3D, we have a threshold above which we can expect that any remaining $Z$ scores are unlikely to have occurred by chance, with a $p<0.05$."

      "I oversimplified when I said above that the expected EC depends only on the number of resels in the image. In fact, this is an approximation, which works well when the volume that we are looking at has a reasonable number of resels. This is true for our two dimensional example, where the FWHM was 8 and our image was 128 by 128. However, the precise EC depends not only on the number of resels, but the shape of the volume in which the resels are contained. It is possible to derive a formula for the expected EC, based on the number of resels in the area we are thresholding, and the shape of the area (see Worsley 1996). This formula is more precise than the formula taking account of the number of resels alone. When the area to be thresholded is large, compared to the FWHM, as is the case when we are thresholding the whole brain, the two formulae give very similar results. However, when the volume for thresholding is small, the formulae give different results, and the shape of the area must be taken into account. This is the case when you require a threshold for a small volume, such as a region of interest."
